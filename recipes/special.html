        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> One serving of pasta </li>
            <li> Butter to taste </li>
            <li> Cream cheese to taste </li>
            <li> Two large eggs </li>
            <li> Salt to taste </li>
            <li> Black pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Frozen vegetables </li>
            <li> Cherry tomatoes </li>
            <li> Any other food that brings you joy and comfort </li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large pot, bring 300mL of water to a boil and add the pasta. Salt it to taste. </li>
            <li> Once the pasta is done, drain the water and set to medium heat. Add butter to the pot and wait for it to cover the bottom before setting it back to the heat. Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to the pot. </li>
            <li> Once the butter has fully melted, add the two eggs and stir it around to evenly spread them. If you like the yolk, you can also make some space for it in the pasta and let it cook whole instead of breaking it. Wait until the egg whites are fully cooked. </li>
            <li> Add the cream cheese and mix it within the pasta. Stir until the cream cheese melts and the pasta has a creamy texture.</li>
        </ol>
